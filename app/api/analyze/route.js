Create a HIGHLY PERSONALIZED career roadmap in JSON format. Use ALL the information above to tailor recommendations.

**PERSONALIZATION REQUIREMENTS:**
1. If GPA is high (3.5+), target competitive companies (FAANG, top consulting)
2. If GPA is lower, focus on portfolio/skills and mid-tier companies
3. If they have projects, build upon them in portfolio recommendations
4. If career motivation mentions specific interests, align company recommendations
5. If they prefer startups, recommend fast-paced learning and startup-relevant skills
6. If they prefer work-life balance, avoid recommending startups with "grind culture"
7. If remote preference, prioritize remote-friendly companies
8. If alternative roles provided, include transition paths
9. Adjust timeline intensity based on job search status (active = more urgent)
10. Match learning resources to their stated work style
